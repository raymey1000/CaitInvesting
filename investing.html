        <summary>Should I get a high yield saving account?</summary>
        <p>A high yield checking account is not really that useful. I feel it's mainly a ploy to join the bank.</p>
        <p>Getting a brokerage account is much more advantageous, a brokerage:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>has money market funds with higher yield than bank accounts but can be accessed the same</li>
          <li>has index funds of stocks with much higher return than bank accounts (10%, ~7% real)</li>
          <li>has Roth IRA accounts with tax-free investing for tuition, first home and retirement</li>
          <li>has access to bonds and bond funds which may be useful</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You'd want the money in your checking account to stay roughly stable while the amount in the brokerage account grows over your life. Example: 2% in checking/CDs, 9% in house, 89% in brokerage.</p>

        <summary>Which Brokerage should I use?</summary>
        <p>Though your mum and I are with Fidelity the best brokerage is 
        <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/" target="_blank">Vanguard</a>, as they are less likely to trick you into high expense products and they are setup so profits go back to account holders.  
        You can open an <a href="https://move-money.web.vanguard.com/registration-check" target="_blank">account here</a>.</p>

        <summary>If I open a brokerage account what should I invest in?</summary>
        <p>I'd say open a brokerage account and move a part of your savings over and invest in money market funds first.  
        Vanguard offers a <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/money-markets" target="_blank">range of options</a>, even the safe federal one is ~4% right now.</p>
        <p>Rule of thumb: the longer the goal and the more risk you can take, the more you put in stocks. For shorter-term goals like a house deposit or tuition, keep more in money markets.</p>
        <p>For stocks a very common fund is 
        <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtsax" target="_blank">VTSAX</a>, diversified across all US stocks, with very low expense ratio and strong returns.</p>
        <p>Another option is Roth IRA investing.</p>

        <summary>How should I use a Roth IRA?</summary>
        <p>A Roth IRA means you don't pay taxes on your gains. Best used for investments with long-term growth (like VTSAX held 10+ years). They can be used for tuition, first home purchase, and retirement (after age 59Â½).</p>
        <p>Your mum and I will match what you put into a Roth IRA each year. The 2025 limit is $7,000. If you invest $3,500, weâ€™ll add $3,500 to meet the limit.</p>

        <summary>What about Bitcoin or Nvidia stock?</summary>
        <p>Cryptocurrency is very high risk and hard to understand. Individual stocks can have high gains but, like crypto, can go to zero. When you buy the total stock market (or S&P 500) they will never go to zero, and even during the Great Depression the market recovered.</p>
        <p>There are two types of investor: passive vs active. Passive investing uses buy-and-hold, while active investors trade frequently. Passive investing is super easy, takes little time, and often has huge gains over time.  
        In fact, <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/active-vs-passive-investing" target="_blank">passive investing often outperforms active investing</a>.</p>

        <summary>What returns would I expect?</summary>
        <p>So letâ€™s say you invest as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Account starts with $5000</li>
          <li>Each year an extra $4000 is added</li>
          <li>$1000 per month is added</li>
          <li>$300 goes into money market at 4%</li>
          <li>$700 goes into VTSAX</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After 20 years this could return about <b>$840K</b>.</p>
        <img src="returnGraph.png" alt="Investment Growth Graph" class="graph">
        <p>Even though the money market has a nice return, the compounding of VTSAX really drives the long-term growth.</p>
