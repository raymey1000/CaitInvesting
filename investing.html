        <summary>Should I get a high yield saving account?</summary>
        <p>
          A high yield checking account is not really that useful. I feel it's mainly a ploy to join the bank.
        </p>
        <p>Getting a brokerage account is much more advantageous, a brokerage:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>has money market funds with higher yield than bank accounts but can be accessed the same</li>
          <li>has index funds of stocks with much higher return than bank accounts (10%, ~7% real)</li>
          <li>has Roth IRA accounts with tax-free investing for tuition, first home and retirement</li>
          <li>has access to bonds and bond funds which may be useful</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You'd want the money in your checking account to stay roughly stable while the amount in the brokerage account grows over your life.  
          Example: 2% in checking/CDs (expenses + emergency fund), 9% in house, 89% in brokerage.

        <summary>Which Brokerage should I use?</summary>
        <p>
          Though your mum and I are with Fidelity the best brokerage is 
          <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/" target="_blank">Vanguard</a>,  
          as they are less likely to trick you into high expense products and are setup so profits go back to account holders.  
          You can open an <a href="https://move-money.web.vanguard.com/registration-check" target="_blank">account here</a>.

        <summary>If I open a brokerage account what should I invest in?</summary>
        <p>
          I'd say open a brokerage account, move a part of your savings over and invest in money market funds first.  
          Vanguard offers a <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/money-markets" target="_blank">range of options</a>, even the safe federal one is ~4% right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allocation rule of thumb: the longer the goal and the more risk you can take, the more you put in stocks.  
          For shorter term goals like house deposit or tuition, keep more in money markets.
        </p>
        <p>
          For stocks a very common fund is 
          <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtsax" target="_blank">VTSAX</a>,  
          which is diversified across all US stocks, has very low expense ratio, and a great return.
        </p>
        <p>Another great option is Roth IRA investing.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>How should I use a Roth IRA?</summary>
        <p>
          A Roth IRA means you don't pay taxes on your gains. Best used for investments with long-term growth (like VTSAX held 10+ years).  
          They can be used for tuition, first home purchase, and retirement (after age 59Â½).
        </p>
        <p>
          Your mum and I will match what you put into a Roth IRA each year.  
          The 2025 limit is $7,000. So if you invest $3,500, weâ€™ll contribute $3,500 to meet the limit.
